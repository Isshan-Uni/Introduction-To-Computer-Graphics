This project contains a single Shader Graph that implements 3 lighting shaders: 
- Simple Diffuse Lighting  
- Diffuse Lighting with Ambient  
- Simple Specular  

Each shader can be toggled on or off individually, or combined.  


This is a screenshot of what is in the project from left to right top row then bottom row-
1. Diffuse only
2. Ambient only
3. Specular only
4. Diffuse + Ambient
5. Diffuse + Specular
6. Ambient + Specular
7. None (all toggles off)
8. All three combined
