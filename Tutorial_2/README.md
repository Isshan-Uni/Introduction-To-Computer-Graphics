Today during the challenges the part which i got stuck at was the challenge 2 where we use the vector 3 node , I was trying to find a node containing rgb variables not x , y , z . Second problem i faced was the T variable in lerp. To fix that I made a public variable which I can change from inspector and assigned it to T in lerp which controls the blend value between the 2 textures .
